# WGAN (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network)

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** to generate synthetic images from a noise vector. WGAN improves the training stability of GANs by using the Wasserstein loss with weight clipping.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Implemented using **PyTorch**
- Uses **Wasserstein Loss** instead of traditional GAN loss
- Trains on **MNIST dataset**
- Generates realistic handwritten digits
- Includes model training and sample image saving

##  Theory Behind WGAN

Traditional GANs often suffer from instability and mode collapse due to vanishing gradients. WGAN replaces the standard binary cross-entropy loss with the **Wasserstein loss**, leading to:

- Better convergence
- Improved sample diversity
- Easier training with meaningful loss metrics

### WGAN Objective:

**Critic Loss:**
```math
L = E[D(x)] - E[D(G(z))]
```

**Generator Loss:**
```math
L = -E[D(G(z))]
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

To start training:

```bash
python wgan.py
```

It will:
- Train the model on MNIST
- Save generated images every few epochs in `/images`
- Save final models in `/models`

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Output

Here are a few images generated by the WGAN after training:

## ðŸ“ˆ Training Progress

The generator improves as the critic learns better approximations of the Wasserstein distance.
